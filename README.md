BSAManager
====

This project allows you to open the media files (*.bsa) for the Bethesda games Oblivion, Fallout 3 and Skyrim.

The media files are the models, textures, sounds and animations. 

The related esm file (which contains the actual world state) can be opened by my ESMLoader project.
